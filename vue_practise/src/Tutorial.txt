Components in Vue Basics :
    A Componenet in Vue consists of three parts they are 
        1.Template part , they are responsible for the changes in the UI , i.e they contains the HTML part of the UI  
        2.Script Part , they hold up the functionality of the component like the Javascript part 
        3.Style Part , they hold up the style and designing of the html tags etc for the component 


    Binding text : 
        1.Text Interpolation by using Mustache syntax
        2.Directive method 

        1.Text Interpolation :
            Here we render the text are the information that is present in the script for dynamic changing purpose by using the Mustache Syntax which is "{{ variable name}}" inside which we will be giving the variable  that is used in the script part ;
            There can be as many as mustache syntax in a component     

        2. Directive Method:
            In this method we will be using the v-text attribute in the element in which the text to be render on.Here we 
        
    Binding HTML :
        In some scenerio we will have to render a Html code into the webpage directly so for that purpose we will be using the HTML directive the  "v-html" along with the initialisation of the variable   
        ex:<span v-html="binHtml"></span>

    Binding Attribute :
        In Vue we can add the attribute also using the bind method ,we can bind id,name etc and some boolean attributes like disabled,required etc. For that we will be using a attributecalled "v-bind"
        ex: <p v-bind:id="className"> for value attributes
        ex:<button v-bind:disabled="isDisabled">NO</button>

    Binding Classes :
        In Vue we can bind the class into the html element .Here there are two types of classes they are static (those that are pre-defined in the template area ) and the dynamic class are 
        those that are changed dynamically by the users

        Example
        data(){
            return{
            isDisabled:true,
            isActive:true,
            status:"warning"
        } 

        <template>
            <h2 :class="{isActive}">Welcome</h2>
        </template>      

        So here we can see the isActive class is binded to the h2 tag

        <template>
            <h2 :class="{active:isActive,disabled:isDisabled}">Welcome</h2>
        </template>

        So now you can see that the h2 element will have both classes active and disabled 
        if the isDisabled value is false then only active will apply 

    Binding Styles :
        In VueJS we can bind the styles into the html element by the "v-bind:style" 

    Conditional Rendering in Vue JS 
        In VueJs we can do conditional Rendering that is that part will b executed when the desired condition satisfies 
        There are 4 methods for Conditional Rendering
            1. v-if
            2. v-else
            3. v-elseif
            4. v-show   

        This means that v-if will actually destroy and recreate elements when the conditional is toggled. Meanwhile, v-show will always keep the element in the DOM and will only toggle its display by changing its CSS.

        The key difference is that v-if conditionally renders elements and v-show conditionally displayselements.
